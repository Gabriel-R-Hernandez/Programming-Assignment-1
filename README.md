ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
When I made the function, I first thought about how to take a word and break it into letters. Then I used Python’s sorted() to arrange those letters in order from A to Z. After that, I had to stick the letters back together using ''.join(). Finally, I just returned the new word so it shows the letters sorted.

EMOTIFY PROBLEM
When I made this, I started by thinking of a dictionary that matches certain words to emojis. Then, I split the sentence into words so I could check each one. For every word, I replaced it with the emoji if it matched, or just kept the word if not. At the end, I joined everything back together into one sentence

LIST PROBLEM
First, I made a list with some numbers. Then, I used Python’s unpacking trick to grab the first number, the middle part, and the last number. The star * helps catch all the middle numbers in between. Finally, I just printed them out so it’s clear which is first, middle, and last.
